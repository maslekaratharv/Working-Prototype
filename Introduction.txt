       Older women (65+ years old) die of heart disease, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and accidental injuries but
are more likely to be afflicted with one or more chronic conditions that can cause limitations in their lifestyles 
(for example, diabetes, hypertension, arthritis).

       Lifestyle change like being physically active every day helps to prevent a heart disease and live healthy life. 
Research has shown that at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity physical activity can help lower 
blood pressure, lower cholesterol and keep your weight at a healthy level. Studies show that people who have achieved 
even a moderate level of fitness are much less likely to die early than those with a low fitness level.

       High knees and toe touch exercise are a cardio-intensive exercise performed at a fast pace. It 
engages your core, strengthens all the muscles in your legs, gets your heart rate up and improves momentum, 
coordination and flexibility. Exercising high knees and toe touch can make Sunita Sharma's health and life 
better.
