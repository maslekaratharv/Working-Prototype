       Older women (65+ years old) die of heart disease, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and accidental injuries but
are more likely to be afflicted with one or more chronic conditions that can cause limitations in their lifestyles 
(for example, diabetes, hypertension, arthritis).

Research has shown that at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity physical activity can help lower 
blood pressure, lower cholesterol and keep your weight at a healthy level. Studies show that people who have achieved 
even a moderate level of fitness are much less likely to die early than those with a low fitness level.
